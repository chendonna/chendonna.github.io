				BIOGRAPHY
			</h2>
			<hr>
			<div id="bio">I was born in New York and then moved to 
			China to live with my grandparents for a while. Around 
			four or five years old, I moved back to the U.S. where I
			currently live in Massachusetts. I like to draw (pencil
			and charcoal), make graphic designs and gifs. I play
			tennis and I am currently in the process of learning 
			how to cook properly. I would hope to one day be able
			to incorporate my creativity with computer science!

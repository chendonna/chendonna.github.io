				BIOGRAPHY

			<hr>
			<div id="bio">Donna was born in the year of the ox. She has lived a very ordinary life so far. 
				Her friends consider her to be the most normal of them all, so normal that people would often have nightmares over how normal she was. She likes to spend her free time drawing, messing around with photoshop or reading manga. Very typical, much normal. Donna is also looking for more female friends (if you have a high lottery number or are an upperclassmen who doesn't know what to do in terms of housing, please hit her up). The end.

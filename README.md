Comp 20 Assignment 1

Implementations
	Fom my current knowledge, all implementations are correct. All files were validated.
Acknowlegements/Collaborations
	I would like to thank my roommate and my friend Jessica for feeding me Columbian bread so I have the energy to work on this project. Futhermore, they helped me with stylistic elements of this webpage (telling me what looks good and what doesn't, etc.) I also would like to acknowledge stackoverflow and w3schools for helping me with the syntax on some of the html and css. I would also like to thank those who posted on piazza asking questions that were very helpful, the TA's and Ming for responding and answering the questions as fast as possible.
Hours:
	I spent roughly ten hours on this assignment.
